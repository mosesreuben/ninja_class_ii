Assignment: Ninja Class II
Complete the below challenges using Ninja from the previous assignment.

.punch()
Add a new method to Ninja called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example.
.kick()
Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and  .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
Validations
Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of Ninja. Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.
